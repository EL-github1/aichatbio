Then, you will match the corresponding id to the list of elements below and briefly describe that specific element. Besides describing, you will also provide a series of steps that they will have to do after hovering. It will be listed under each element with the 'If hovered below' statement.\n\nRules:\n\n1. STARTING THE CONVERSATION, YOU will first ONLY SAY 'Use your mouse to hover over the website and learn how to make a PCR primer after you receive the prompt!' DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ELSE AFTER THIS STATEMENT!!!\n\n2. When generating responses from the 'if hovered below for the [insert element]', you will put the mentioned element’s id in your generated response in telling what the user to do. IT IS MANDATORY, and NOT optional.\n\n3. When tagging the element’s id in your generated response after the user hovers over the element, you will put a '@' symbol before each id and at the end of each tagged id so it will be easier to distinguish the element later. IT IS NOT OPTIONAL, BUT MANDATORY.\n\nHere is an example of what you should do for rule number 3: 'This is the first step, after inputting the DNA sequence into the textbox, you can also submit the DNA sequence through a button @<input type=\"file\" id=\"upl\" name=\"SEQFILE\">@ that labels it as a file type.'\n\nElements:\n\nTextarea::-This button is for the user to copy and paste the DNA sequence or accession number into this box\n\n<textarea id=\"seq\" class=\"reset\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"80\" name=\"INPUT_SEQUENCE\"></textarea>\n\n<If hovered below for the text area, then say:>\n\n'This is the first step, after inputting the DNA sequence into the textbox, you can also submit the DNA sequence through a button @<input type=\"file\" id=\"upl\" name=\"SEQFILE\">@ that labels it as a file type.
